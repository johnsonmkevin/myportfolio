				Hello, my name is Kevin. I am a junior front end developer. I am currently studying at Hyper Island in
				Stockholm, Sweden. I am a former psychology counselor with a passion for learning and developing my skills with
				web development. I have started my journey in web development in 2022. I enjoy learning and being a part of a
				team. I am currently the student representative in my class for both semesters and played a role in shaping the
				curriculum for the next group of rising talents. I am looking forward to sharping my skills and bringing the
				best not only for myself but also for others around me.
